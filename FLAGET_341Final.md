Finally, I have finished my portfolio website. This project had a quite a few unexpected twists and turns due to errors and misunderstandings here and there. But I have finally finished and am pretty happy with this foundation for my professional portfolio.

I didn't base this portfolio off of anything in particular, but had a general idea of what I wanted. I wanted a dark theme with high contrast colors and plenty of white-space. I think that this aesthetic is comes across as simple yet elegant. I wanted to give the impression that my like my portfolio, my work is simple yet polished.

I chose to design my site as a portfolio. This would serve as a showcase to possible employers and a way to get exposure as a freelance graphic designer. The thought being that someone hears about my freelance services through word of mouth, looks me up, sees my work, decides that I produce the caliber of work they desire, and hires me. As mentioned above, I wanted something dark, high contrast, and relatively simple. I want my site to stand out, but also speak for itself and be easy to skim. I am catering to the lowest common denominator: modern people with short attention spans. Because of that, skimability is crucial. But also wanted to include more information so people can delve deeper into the work that they find interesting or most pertains to their needs. That is why my main page only features a few of my works. People can navigate to the type of work that most interests them or click on specific works to gain info on the context of the project. I hope to eventually create a more diverse portfolio of work and clients to improve my credibility.

True to mobile first design, the site is designed to be functional in a mobile format and gains features as display size increase. The template was originally a one-page theme so the majority of my content can be seen without having to wait for another page to load, an important factor in mobile traffic. Even when testing the sit eon my cheap smartphone, the load times was pretty respectable (for both WiFi and cellular data). There was about a half second delay as the hero loaded, but that's to be expected because it has to be high res enough to display on a large screen too. Load times were much better on the other two pages. At around a tablet breakpoint, the hamburger menu converts into a full navigation bar with a scrolling function. Also around that point the icons and portfolio modules begin to move from a one-column display to two-column. This changes to a three-column display at as we move into a desktop display size. Even larger display sizes gain larger images and more white-space. Throughout the upscaling process, the footer, hero section, and contact text boxes gradually expand in width to utilize the available screen space.

I based much of the functionality off of the code that was prebuilt into the theme. It had quite a few really cool animations and other features that I enjoyed. Most of what I did was play with organization on the page, customized images, and different page sections. I used the format from the rebuilt sections, but renamed and repurposed many of them. I encountered a multitude of issues with image links and relative links between pages and page sections. It always amazes how much havoc a single misplaced character can cause. Linter were not always helpful in catching this. I also experienced major issues when trying to import a different lightbox system into the template and ended up scraping the idea. I think that it was for the better anyways. The one I had thought about incorporating only added the feature of scrolling to the next lightbox instead of clicking out and into another. But it didn't support longer descriptions to be displayed below the lightbox. For my purposes, I think that the descriptions are more important that one convenient feature. I also had a heck of a time incorporating formspree into my contact section. It just involved a lot of trial and error and Reddit forums. I eventually got it working and didn't have to sacrifice the neat display that came prebuilt in the template. As you know, I had a lot of Windows based issues with Sass. We finally found somewhat of solution with that Koala manager but even then it was glitchy. Because of that I didn't utilize Sass as much as I would have liked to.

As for future work, I need to get a lot more content up there. I feel like 6 examples of each format is okay, but I would want to have more options out there. Probably closer to 12-15 of each, ranked in order of which ones I find to be my best work. I did do some work incorporating Google Analytics and search engine optimization, but that is a rabbit hole that I have only begun to explore. There is much more that I could improve in that area. I am however happy to report that my site now appears within the first 5 search results when you search my name. When I first put it up, I couldn't find it within the first two pages of Google search. I also tried to register my site with Bing, but it turned out to be a waste of time because the SAVE button on their form was broken. I can taste the irony. I would love to eventually have my site be number one in multiple engines when you search my name. I'm sure that there are more trick that I can use to improve my load time, particularly in regards to my hero section. This is something I plan to maintain for a few years at least. As I progress into my career, I will likely purchase a domain and a hosting service. I may even decide to rebuild the site from the ground up just to test how much my skills have improved. I definitely need to play with Sass more and get an easy workflow set up with that.

To wrap things up, I really enjoyed this project and this class. I had a lot of fun and felt that it was actually useful material, unlike some of my other classes. I also appreciated how flexible you were with restructuring the class to fit our needs. I look forward to taking your classes in the future.
