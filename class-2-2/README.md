Hello again,

This week's work went fairly well, I think. Some of the syntax was a but
challenging, but Atom helped by pointing out problems as I went along. The
instructions and examples on GitHub really helped too. My biggest mistake
was probably when I dropped the story in. I broke it up into managable lines
(which took forever) and then had to tab in the blocks. Hence why my lines
of code are a little long. This task probably took me longer than it should have
(about 3 hours) but I think I learned a lot.
