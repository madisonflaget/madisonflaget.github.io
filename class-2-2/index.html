        <h2> The Two Frogs </h2>

        <p>
          Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom
          made his home in a ditch near the town of <dfn>Osaka</dfn><sub>1</sub>,
          on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which
          ran through the city of <dfn>Kyoto</dfn><sub>2</sub>. At
          such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but,
          funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at once that they should
          like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kyoto wanted to
          visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kyoto, where the
          great Mikado had his palace.
          So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led
          from Kyoto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other. The
          journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about
          traveling, and halfway between the two towns there arose a mountain which
          had to be climbed. It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach
          the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to
          see another frog before him!
        </p>

        <p>
          They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into
          conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes.
          It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little
          more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched
          themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good
          rest before they parted to go their ways.
        </p>

        <q>
          What a pity we are not bigger," said the Osaka frog; "for then we could see
          both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on.
        </q>

        <q>
          Oh, that is easily managed," returned the Kyoto frog. "We have only got to
          stand up on our hind legs, and hold onto each other, and then we can each look
          at the town he is traveling to.
        </q>

        <p>
          This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his
          front paws on the shoulder of his friend, who had risen also. There they both
          stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and holding each other
          tightly, so that they might not fall down.

          <figure>

              </figcaption>
          </figure>

          The Kyoto frog turned his nose
          towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose towards Kyoto; but the
          foolish things forgot that when they stood up their great eyes lay in the backs
          of their heads, and that though their noses might point to the places to which
          they wanted to go, their eyes beheld the places from which they had come.
        </p>

        <q>
          <strong>Dear me!</strong>" cried the Osaka frog, "Kyoto is <em>exactly</em>
          like Osaka. It is certainly not worth such a long journey. I shall go home!
        </q>

        <q>
          If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kyoto I should never have
          traveled all this way," exclaimed the frog from Kyoto, and as he spoke he took
          his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell down on the grass.
          Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for home again,
          and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and Kyoto, which are as
          different to look at as two towns can be, were as alike as two peas.
        </q>
