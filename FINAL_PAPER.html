Finally, I have finished my portfolio website. This project had a quite a few unexpected twists and turns due to errors and misunderstandings here and there. But I have finally finished and am pretty happy with this foundation for my professional portfolio.

I didn't base this porfolio off anything in particular, but had a general idea of what I wanted. I wanted a dark theme with high contrast colors and plenty of white-space. I think that this aesthetic is comes across as simple yet elegant. I wanted to give the impression that my like my portfolio, my work is simple yet polished.

I chose to design my site as a portfolio. This would serve as a showcase to possible employers and a way to get exposure as a freelance graphic designer. The being that someone hears about my freelance services thorugh word of mouth, looks me up, sees my works, decides that I produce the claiber of work they desire. As mentioned above, I wanted something dark, high contrast, and relatively simple. I want my site to stand out, but also speak for itself and be easy to skim. True to mobile first design, the site is designed to be funtional in a mobile format and gains features as size increase. At around a tablet breakpoint, the hanburger menu converts into a full nav bar with a scrolling function. Also at around the tablet breakpoint the icons and portfolio modules begin to move from a one-column display to two-column. This changes to a three columns display at as we move into a destop display size. Throughout the upscaling process, the footer, hero section, and contact text boxes gradually expand in width to utilize the available screen width

I based much of the funtionality off of the code that  was prebuilt into the theme. It had guite a few really cool animations and other features that I enjoyed. Most of what I did was play with organization on the page, customized images, and different page sections. I used the format for the rebuilt sections, but renamed and repurposed many of them. I encounterered many issues with image links and realtive links between pages and page sections. It always amazes how much havoc a single misplaced character can cause. I also expreience major issues when trying to import a different lightbox system into the template and ended up scraping the idea. I think that it was the better anyways. The one I had though about incorporating only added the feature of scrolling to the next lightbox instead of clicking out and into another. But it didn't support longer desriptions to be displayed below the lightbox. For my purposes, I think that the descriptions are more important that one convenient feature. I also had  a  heck of a time incorporating formspree into my Contact section. It just involved a lot of trial and error and Reddit forums. I eventually got it working and didn't have to sacrafice the neat diplay that came brebuilt in the template.

As for future work, I need to get a lot mroe content up there. I feel like 6 example of each format is okay, but I would want to have more options up there. Probably closer to 12-15 of each. I did do some work incorporating Google Analytics and search engine optimization, but that is a rabbit hole that I have only begun to explore. There is much more that I could improve in that area.
