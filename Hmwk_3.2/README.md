Yeah, so this was kind of a pain. I felt a bit overwhelmed with all of the new info
we learned and applied all at once. Also the examples you gave us sometimes contradicted
each other in regards to the info that needed to be included. Specifically, I was
very unsure about what elements needed an id tag and which ones did not. Maybe
this will make more sense once I learn how they are used in CSS?

I was happily surprised by the many things that we can create with a few lines of
code. The way the browser rendered our code looked nicer than I was expecting.
I expected it to look like something straight out of the 90s.

I'm very glad that I already have Premiere because clipping that video to 3
seconds would have been a huge pain otherwise.
