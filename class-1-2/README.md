# Homework for Class 1.2
Welcome to Git

[Here is my repository] (https://madisonflaget.github.io)

The homework for this week went fairly well. I had some issues with Source Tree
and had to reinstall it, but I figured it out. The homework had a decent amount
of reading to go along with it, but the assignment itself was very simple. The
only thing that I am still unsure on is what metadata is applicable to the poem.
I am looking forward to doing more intricate things with html.
