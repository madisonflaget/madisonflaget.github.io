		<h1>Quotes from the Tao Te Jing</h1>

		<blockquote>
			If you understand others you are smart. <br>
			If you understand yourself you are illuminated. <br>
			If you overcome others you are powerful. <br>
			If you overcome yourself you have strength. <br>
			If you know how to be satisfied you are rich. <br>
			If you can act with vigor, you have a will. <br>
			If you don't lose your objectives you can be long-lasting. <br>
			If you die without loss, you are eternal. <br>
			 - <em> Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching </em>
